### 🔧 Optimization Plugin Compatibility Fix (September 2025)

**Issue Identified:** File renaming operations in the SelectiveUpload feature were failing when optimization plugins (WebP converters like Smush, Imagify, EWWW) were active. These plugins run during `wp_generate_attachment_metadata()` and create file locks that interfere with renaming.

**Solution Implemented:**
- **Pre-rename Strategy**: Moved file renaming to occur BEFORE `wp_generate_attachment_metadata()` instead of after
- **New Helper Class**: Created `OptimizationCompatibility.php` with advanced conflict handling:
  - File lock detection and waiting mechanisms
  - Temporary optimization plugin disabling
  - Retry logic with exponential backoff (3 attempts)
  - Deferred WebP processing after rename completion
- **Settings Integration**: Added "Enable Optimization Plugin Compatibility" checkbox in Behavior settings
- **Graceful Degradation**: Feature is optional and falls back to standard behavior when disabled

**Files Modified:**
- `includes/Admin/SelectiveUpload.php` - Main upload logic with pre-rename strategy
- `includes/Helpers/OptimizationCompatibility.php` - New compatibility helper (created)
- `includes/Admin/templates/settings-section-behavior.php` - Added new setting
- `includes/Admin/Settings.php` - Added checkbox field support

**Technical Details:**
1. Upload → Create attachment record
2. Pre-process → Generate AI content (alt, title, filename)
3. Pre-rename → Rename file BEFORE metadata generation
4. Optimize → Run `wp_generate_attachment_metadata()` with correct filename
5. Complete → Optimization plugins work with properly named file

This ensures zero conflicts between file renaming and optimization plugins while maintaining full functionality.

### 📝 Next Session Priorities
1. Test optimization plugin compatibility with various WebP plugins
2. Verify default prompts are working after reactivation
3. Test all major functionality after rebranding
4. Create visual assets for WordPress.org submission
5. Final testing before WordPress.org submission
